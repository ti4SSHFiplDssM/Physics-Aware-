# Graph Deep Learning for Fault Detection in Smart Power Grids

A physics-aware graph deep learning framework for accurate, real-time fault detection and diagnosis in smart power grids.

## Overview

With the increasing demand for real-time, robust, and scalable monitoring in modern intelligent infrastructures, traditional fault detection methods fall short due to their reliance on static assumptions and limited adaptability to dynamic grid conditions. This project addresses these challenges with a novel deep learning approach tailored for cyber-physical power systems.

## Key Contributions

- **Physics-Aware Architecture**: Introduces a dual-methodology combining Graph-Embedded Differential Flow Networks (GEDFN) and Spatio-Temporal Policy Alignment (STPA).
- **Graph-Based Modeling**: Leverages spatial and physical relationships between electrical nodes and their operational states.
- **Reinforcement Learning Alignment**: Aligns local control policies with grid-wide operational objectives through STPA.
- **High-Dimensional Data Adaptation**: Effectively handles the complexity and scale of modern smart grids, including time-series and topological changes.

## Framework Components

### 1. Graph-Embedded Differential Flow Networks (GEDFN)
- Models the dynamic electrical states across the grid.
- Integrates spatial structure and physical realism.

### 2. Spatio-Temporal Policy Alignment (STPA)
